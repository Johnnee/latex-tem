		\begin{abstract}
			In this paper, we propose ex-ante characteristics that predict the drop in risk-adjusted performance
			out-of-sample for a large set of stock anomalies published in finance and accounting
			academic journals. Our set of predictors is generated by hypotheses of OOS decay put forward
			by McLean and Pontiff (2016): arbitrage capital flowing into newly published strategies and
			in-sample overfitting linked to multiple hypothesis testing. The year of publication alone
			compatible with both hypotheses—explains 30\% of the variance of Sharpe decay across factors:
			Every year, the Sharpe decay of newly-published factors increases by 5ppt. The other
			important variables are directly related to overfitting: the number of operations required to
			calculate the signal and two measures of sensitivity of in-sample Sharpe to outliers together
			add another 15\% of explanatory power. Some arbitrage-related variables are statistically significant,
			but their predictive power is marginal

	\section{Introduction}
	Although quadrupole excitons (QE) in cuprous oxide crystals are good candidates for BEC due to their narrow\cite{ISI:000614045200001}
	line-width and long life-time there are some factors impeding BEC Assume some density of quadrupole 1S excitons
	created by an external laser pulse\cite{ISI:000614045200001}. The corresponding polaritons move in the crystal as the polariton and can be trapped
	by the PMS due to WGM-QE resonant interaction.
	The WGM evanescent field penetration depth into the cuprous oxide adjacent crystal is much larger than the QE
	radius:Below we compare the evanescent quadrupole polariton and conventional bulk quadrupole polariton in cuprous\cite{ISI:000609465600001}
	oxide. For simplicity let us consider the incident polariton wave vector running along the interface (z direction). The
	polarization of the polariton is taken along the x direction \citep{ISI:000617129000001,ISI:000614810800001}. 
	
	In this section let us utilize the above calculated WGM-QE interaction to obtain the evanescent polariton (EP)
	dispersion in the framework of the coupled oscillator model that has been widely used for describing coupled atomphoton
	or exciton-photon modes in microcavity systems.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\cite{kamilaris2018deep} WGM evanescent field penetration depth into the cuprous oxide adjacent crystal is much larger than the QE
	radius \citep{mackenzie1992risk,deng2014deep,kamilaris2018deep}:Below we compare the evanescent quadrupole polariton and conventional bulk quadrupole polariton in cuprous
	oxide. \citep{goodfellow2016deep} and \cite{kamilaris2018deep} simplicity let us consider the incident polariton wave vector running along the interface (z direction). The
	polarization of the polariton is taken along the x direction.In this section let us utilize the above calculated WGM-QE interaction to obtain the evanescent polariton (EP)
