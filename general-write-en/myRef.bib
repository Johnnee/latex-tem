Abstract = {{Background Clinical risk scores and machine learning models based on
   routine laboratory values could assist in automated early identification
   of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients
   at risk for severe clinical outcomes. They can guide patient triage,
   inform allocation of health care resources, and contribute to the
   improvement of clinical outcomes. Methods In- and out-patients tested
   positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the Insel Hospital Group Bern, Switzerland,
   between February 1st and August 31st ('first wave', n = 198) and
   September 1st through November 16th 2020 ('second wave', n = 459) were
   used as training and prospective validation cohort, respectively. A
   clinical risk stratification score and machine learning (ML) models were
   developed using demographic data, medical history, and laboratory values
   taken up to 3 days before, or 1 day after, positive testing to predict
   severe outcomes of hospitalization (a composite endpoint of admission to
   intensive care, or death from any cause). Test accuracy was assessed
   using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (AUROC). Results Sex, C-reactive protein, sodium, hemoglobin, glomerular
   filtration rate, glucose, and leucocytes around the time of first
   positive testing (- 3 to + 1 days) were the most predictive parameters.
   AUROC of the risk stratification score on training data (AUROC = 0.94,
   positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.97, negative predictive value (NPV)
   = 0.80) were comparable to the prospective validation cohort (AUROC =
   0.85, PPV = 0.91, NPV = 0.81). The most successful ML algorithm with
   respect to AUROC was support vector machines (median = 0.96,
   interquartile range = 0.85-0.99, PPV = 0.90, NPV = 0.58). Conclusion
   With a small set of easily obtainable parameters, both the clinical risk
   stratification score and the ML models were predictive for severe
   outcomes at our tertiary hospital center, and performed well in
   prospective validation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Virtual screening (VS) based on molecular docking has emerged as one of
   the mainstream technologies of drug discovery due to its low cost and
   high efficiency. However, the scoring functions (SFs) implemented in
   most docking programs are not always accurate enough and how to improve
   their prediction accuracy is still a big challenge. Here, we propose an
   integrated platform called ASFP, a web server for the development of
   customized SFs for structure-based VS. There are three main modules in
   ASFP: (1) the descriptor generation module that can generate up to 3437
   descriptors for the modelling of protein-ligand interactions; (2) the
   AI-based SF construction module that can establish target-specific SFs
   based on the pre-generated descriptors through three machine learning
   (ML) techniques; (3) the online prediction module that provides some
   well-constructed target-specific SFs for VS and an additional generic SF
   for binding affinity prediction. Our methodology has been validated on
   several benchmark datasets. The target-specific SFs can achieve an
   average ROC AUC of 0.973 towards 32 targets and the generic SF can
   achieve the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.81 on the PDBbind
   version 2016 core set. To sum up, the ASFP server is a powerful tool for
   structure-based VS.}},

   infrastructure}},
Journal = {{INSIGHTS INTO IMAGING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{AI provides tremendous opportunities for improving patient care, but at
   present there is little evidence of real-world uptake. An important
   barrier is the lack of well-designed, vendor-neutral and future-proof
   infrastructures for deployment. Because current AI algorithms are very
   narrow in scope, it is expected that a typical hospital will deploy many
   algorithms concurrently. Managing stand-alone point solutions for all of
   these algorithms will be unmanageable. A solution to this problem is a
   dedicated platform for deployment of AI. Here we describe a blueprint
   for such a platform and the high-level design and implementation
   considerations of such a system that can be used clinically as well as
   for research and development. Close collaboration between radiologists,
   data scientists, software developers and experts in hospital IT as well
   as involvement of patients is crucial in order to successfully bring AI
   to the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{HighlightsA fully fabric-based mechanical energy harvester with a

   flexible and stretchable textiles with self-powered sensors bring a
   novel insight into wearable functional electronics and cyber security in
   the era of Internet of Things. This work presents a highly flexible and
   self-powered fully fabric-based triboelectric nanogenerator (F-TENG)
   with sandwiched structure for biomechanical energy harvesting and
   real-time biometric authentication. The prepared F-TENG can power a
   digital watch by low-frequency motion and respond to the pressure change
   by the fall of leaves. A self-powered wearable keyboard (SPWK) is also
   fabricated by integrating large-area F-TENG sensor arrays, which not
   only can trace and record electrophysiological signals, but also can
   identify individuals' typing characteristics by means of the Haar
   wavelet. Based on these merits, the SPWK has promising applications in
   the realm of wearable electronics, self-powered sensors, cyber security,
   and artificial intelligences.}},

Title = {{Monthly surface runoff prediction using artificial intelligence: A study
   from a tropical climate river basin}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Accurate surface runoff prediction is vital for water resources
   engineers for various applications. Advances in the artificial
   intelligence techniques can act as robust tools for modelling
   hydrological processes. The present study focuses on testing the
   reliability of different data sources and choosing the correct source to
   model the rainfall-runoff process under data scarce situations using AI
   techniques. In this study, an absolute homogeneity test was performed
   for TRMM, gridded and observed precipitation data and found that the
   observed precipitation dataset is homogeneous and best suitable for
   modelling rainfall-runoff process in Kallada river basin, Kerala.
   Emotional artificial neural network (EANN) is a novel hybrid neural
   network and it is suggested in the present study for accurate monthly
   surface runoff prediction. This study was also conceived to address and
   investigate the efficiency of EANN for forecasting monthly surface
   runoff and compare the performances with conventional feed forward
   neural network (FFNN) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS)
   models. Suitable goodness-of-fit criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of
   determination (R-2) and graphical indicators are used for assessing the
   efficacy of the developed models. The results showed that the EANN model
   performs better with R-2 = 0.80 for the training phase and R-2 = 0.77
   for validation phase compared to other models. The improvement in the
   performance of EANN model over FFNN model is 12\% and 5.8\% for
   coefficient of determination in the training and validation phase,
   respectively. Further, the Taylor diagram indicates that there is a
   close match between the observed and EANN model predicted values in
   terms of statistical parameters. Overall, this study demonstrated the
   effectiveness of EANN in modelling the rainfall-runoff process and also
   could be a useful technique in other fields of water resources
   engineering.}},
