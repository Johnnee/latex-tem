	Abstract = {{With the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare systems across the world
	have been pushed to the brink. The approach of traditional healthcare
	systems to disaster preparedness and prevention has demonstrated
	intrinsic problems, such as failure to detect early the spread of the
	virus, public hospitals being overwhelmed, a dire shortage of personal
	protective equipment, and exhaustion of healthcare workers.
	Consequently, this situation resulted in manpower and resource costs,
	leading to the widespread and exponential rise of infected cases at the
	early stage of the epidemic. To limit the spread of infection, the
	Chinese government adopted innovative, specialized, and advanced
	systems, including empowered Fangcang and Internet hospitals, as well as
	high technologies such as 5G, big data analysis, cloud computing, and
	artificial intelligence. The efficient use of these new forces helped
	China win its fight against the virus. As the rampant spread of the
	virus continues outside China, these new forces need to be integrated
	into the global healthcare system to combat the disease. Global
	healthcare system integrated with new forces is essential not only for
	COVID-19 but also for unknown infections in the future.}},
